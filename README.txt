The next smallest self-dual embeddable graphs in pseudosurfaces

by Steven Schluchter and Juan Manuel Lazaro Ruiz.

The article is in preparation.

To view the results of our analysis of the 11 candidate graphs mentioned in the article, please see the /results folder.

To run an analysis of graphn using our code, run the command

python self_dual_fourteen_edges.py graphn all

and keep in mind that it takes a very long time to run an analysis of 14! permutations of the edges of a graph with 14 edges.

___***The next smallest self-dual embeddable graphs in pseudosurfaces***___

by Steven Schluchter and Juan Manuel Lazaro Ruiz

to appear in Missouri Journal of Mathematical Sciences (MJMS).

To view the results of our analysis of the 11 candidate graphs mentioned in the article, please see the `/results` folder.

To run an analysis of `graphn` using our code, run the following command:

```python self_dual_fourteen_edges.py graphn all```.

Keep in mind that it takes a very long time to run an analysis of 14! permutations of the edges of a graph with 14 edges.
